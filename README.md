# wp_hacked

Few days ago my wp site got hacked by http://kacottagexk.kenrei.top/ .
I found the hell file in my index.php and folders
It creating fake sitemap and generating fake html pages to google bot and storing user password into plugins/log.txt

## How to stop

First rename public_html to public_html_back
download WORDPRESS and replace all code.
delete all shell files.
rename public_html_back to public_html
